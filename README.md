My solutions to CodeWars kata challenges

The repository is broken up into the 8 tiers that CodeWars uses to rank the difficulty of its challenges. Tier 8 is the easiest level and Tier 1 is the hardest. Each file represents a single kata (challenge) with the top portion of the code being the solution and the problem prompt below in block comments.
